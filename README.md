# 🐱🐶 Cat vs Dog Classification using SVM  

## 📌 Project Overview  
This project implements a **Support Vector Machine (SVM)** model to classify images of cats and dogs.  
We use **HOG (Histogram of Oriented Gradients)** features for image representation and train an SVM classifier for binary classification.

## 📂 Dataset  
The dataset used contains labeled images of cats and dogs with filenames such as:  
- `cat.0.jpg`, `cat.1.jpg`, ...  
- `dog.0.jpg`, `dog.1.jpg`, ...  

The dataset should be placed in a folder (e.g., `train_for_SVM/`) containing both cat and dog images.

 We cannot upload the whole dataset as it contains some 25000 images of cats and dogs, gothrough the link and check for the dataset.
